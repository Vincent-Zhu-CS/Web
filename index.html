  <h2>What to look for in a smartphone</h2>
  <img src="https://sm.mashable.com/t/mashable_in/image/t/the-best-c/the-best-cyber-monday-smartphone-deals-are-right-here_u1tn.960.jpg">
  <p>There are many features which makes up a smartphone, but in general, it can be summarized into 6 categories. 
  These categories being price, screen, camera, processor, operating system, and battery life</p>
  
  <h2>Price</h2>
  <img src="https://myzol.co.zw/Data/Articles/1577/mobile-money__zoom.jpg">
  <p>Like anything else, the most important factor in any purchase is the price. 
  Usually, $400 and below are considered budget,and the $400-900 is considered to be midrange. 
  Anything above are usually a company's flagship/higher end smartphones.
  The best value smartphones are usually founded in the $600-800 price range.</p>
  
  <h2>Screen</h2>

  <p></p>The screen of a smartphone can be splitted into 3 different categories, pixel density, display technology and refresh rate.
The pixel density determines how clear your phone screen is, in other word, its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz2GAof9tI">resolution</a>
There are 2 main type of display technology founded in modern smartphones, LCD and OLED. LCD displays has one backlight that shines on all the pixels
while each individual pixel produces their own lights in OLED displays. Generally, OLED produces better looking image as shown <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADWDgTvxemo">here</a>
Refresh rates are measured in hz, and basically determines how many time your screen refreshes per second. The standard refresh rate of phones
is 60hz, but there are phones with 90hz or even 120hz out there. In short, the higher the refresh rate the smoother your phone feels  

  <h2>Camera</h2>
  <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TbFEdJb6E7cJ5EonZB9eSS.jpg">
  <p>There are 3 main type of camera lenses on a smartphone. The telephoto, ultrawide, and main. The telephoto camera allows you to zoom in more,
  the ultrawide allow you to take large wide photo shots, and the main lenses is basically your default camera and it is also usually the best.
  Camera is one of the biggest selling point of a smartphone and is often the part where midrange and buget phone cheaps out. Most higher end
  phones also has a "night mode" feature which allows them to take better photos at night.</p>
  
  <h2>Processor</h2>
  <p>Like in a desktop pc, the processor is responsible for a smartphone's performance. In smartphone market, there are 3 CPU providers; Apple
  Samsung, and Qualcomm who produces the A series, Exynos series, and the Snappdragon series respectively. There are some other mobile processors 
  out there such as the Kirin series which are limited to Huawei phones and Dimensity series which is limited to China. Performance of these 
  processor can be found <a href="https://www.techcenturion.com/smartphone-processors-ranking">here</a> </p>
  
  <h2>Operating System</h2>
  <img src="https://cdn01.vulcanpost.com/wp-uploads/2018/10/AndroidvsiOS_Feature.jpg">
  <p>There are 2 main type of operating system avilable, Android and IOS. Android is developed by Google and is what the majority of phone 
  manufactuers uses. IOS is an operating system developed by Apple and only appears on iPhones. The biggest difference between the 2 
  systems is that Android is open source, and generally has more customizability to it. Meanwhile, IOS features is all controlled by Apple,
  meaning it is what determine your user experience. Different companies also apply custom "skins" over the basic android interface
  that typically alters the UI to suits what the manufactuers wants. After Huawei's ban from Google, the Chinese megacorporation has also 
  developed thier own operating system known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HarmonyOS">Harmony OS</a></p>

<h2>Battery Life</h2>
  <img src="https://image.shutterstock.com/image-vector/battery-charge-indicator-icons-vector-260nw-1094553101.jpg">
  <p>The battery that makes up a smartphone is measured in milliamp-hours, or mAh for short. Typically, the larger the battery, the longer your phone 
  would last, but that may not always be the case; other factors such as processor and operating system efficiency should also be accounted for. For example,
  Samsung sells two regional variant of their S20 phones, one with a snapdragon chipset and another with their own Exynos chipset. Despite having the same
  battery capacity, <a href="https://wccftech.com/snapdragon-plus-exynos-990-snapdragon-865-battery-life-compared/">the snapdragon variant lasted for almost an hour longer</a> 
  Meanwhile, Apple typically has the smallest battery capacity of all the top tier flagships, but due to their optimization, their battery life are typically
  on par with its competition. Since most users charges their phone at night when they're in bed, all they really need is a phone that can last a full day of usage
  which any phone with 4000+ mAh should be able to do.</p>
